**Summary** <br />
->We have used Raspberry pi 4b to implement this project. <br />
->The remaining hardware components are breadboard, jumper wires and the 15.3 Watt Type-C power charger. <br />
->Connected Vdd of the sensor to 3.3V of Rpi, gnd to gnd, SDA(in) of rpi to SDA(out) of bmp280 module , SCA(out) of rpi to SCK(in) of bmp280 module. <br />

**Kernel Space Driver and itâ€™s build process**
1. Makefile of the device kernel module was executed, creation of object files. <br />

2. "sudo modprobe industrialio" was executed. <br />
3. Insertion of module is done "sudo insmod bmp280.ko". <br />
4. module inserted in "lsmod". <br />

5. "dmesg" was executed to check if the device is registered. <br />

6. I2C slave address is registered by "i2cdetect -y 1". <br />

7. We tried to get data from the sensor but the file isn't created in the \sys\bus\iio\ directory. <br />
8. Hence Device isn't registered. <br />
